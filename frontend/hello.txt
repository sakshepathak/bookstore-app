This project is fully functional on the backend and is built to easily 
integrate with a frontend interface, allowing for a smooth and responsive user experience.
While Iâ€™ve currently tested all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Postman, 
the backend is fully ready to support a beautiful, user-friendly webpage whenever needed.
